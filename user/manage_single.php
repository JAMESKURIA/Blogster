            Permission to Publish

            Modern copyright law is usually talked about as if it is a protection for authors against others "stealing" and profiting from their work without the original creator being rewarded.

            But the original conception was quite a bit different.

            Copyright developed originally as a privilege granted to approved printers of books, who were given an exclusive license to print some particular work. It was a whitelist form of censorship: no one could print anything unless they had been granted the copyright to do so.

            This was at a time when sovereign rights (the rights of rulers) were considered to be more important than the rights of individuals. There was no conception of "Freedom of Speech" as we know it — you literally had to have permission to print something.
            Freedom of Speech

            By the 18th century, and especially after the American Revolution, the conception of Free Speech had become a mostly accepted fact.

            Copyright law could no longer be about granting special permission to print something, because the assumption of Free Speech is that anyone is free to print anything.

            Rather than a license to print something you otherwise wouldn't be allowed to, copyright became a right to stop other people from printing things they otherwise would be allowed to.

            In an era of restriction, copyright was a permission; in an era of freedom, it became a restriction.

            The reason for copyright changed also. Rather than being a form of censorship, the idea became an economic incentive to create.

            The idea behind modern copyright law is that if artists can control who is allowed to copy their creations, then artists can charge for that permission and make money.
            Intellectual Property and Ownership

            So the situation is that without copyright, but with Freedom of Speech, anyone would be able to copy anything they want, even if someone else had created it.

            This might make it difficult for artists to get paid for their work, which might mean that there is less art created (because artists are having to do other things to pay the bills).

            This is the situation modern copyright seeks to correct, and it does so by assigning the exclusive right to make use of a work to the one who created it. It is meant to be a necessary and justified infringement on Freedom of Speech.

            But a secondary cultural effect occurred because of this solution. Because copyright grants exclusive rights to works created by artists, the works themselves came to be regarded as a form of property.

            Hence the term "intellectual property."

            Strictly speaking, the only property at issue in intellectual property is a legal right to produce something.

            This is an asset in a financial sense, so it can be thought of as property. But the metaphor to real property is so strong that people often talk about copyright infringement as a form of stealing.
            Why Does This Matter?

            The common shorthand of referring to copyright as "ownership" and infringement as "stealing," while possibly effective as a deterrent, gives a false impression of the nature of copyright law.

            Having a proper conception of copyright law helps make certain practical applications of it — especially fair use, for example — easier to understand.
